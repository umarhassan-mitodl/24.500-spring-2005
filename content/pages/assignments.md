There is one major assignment in this course. Students must submit a twenty page term paper, on a topic of their choosing. A draft or detailed outline (minimumÂ five pages) must be submitted before the end of the term to Prof. Byrne.

Some sample topics are included below:

1\. Externalism  
Does McKinsey's argument for the incompatibility of externalism and privileged access succeed? If so, which thesis should be rejected?

2\. Entitlement  
Are we "entitled" to self-knowledge? What does that question mean, anyway?

3\. Immunity to error through misidentification  
What is the best way of characterizing "immunity to error through misidentification"? Does this phenomenon hold any lessons for self-knowledge?

4\. Neo-expressivism  
Explain and evaluate Bar-On's neo-expressivist theory.
