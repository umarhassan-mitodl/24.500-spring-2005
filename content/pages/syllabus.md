Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Subject Matter and Format
-------------------------

This is a seminar on "self-knowledge" -- knowledge of one's own mental states. In addition to reading some of the classic papers on self-knowledge, we will look at some very recent work on the topic. There will be no lectures. Each week I will spend half an hour or so introducing the assigned reading, and the rest of the time will be devoted to discussion.

Readings
--------

It will be useful to have a copy of Wright, C., B. C. Smith, and C. Macdonald eds. _Knowing Our Own Minds_. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1998. ISBN: 0198236670.

Ludlow, P., and N. Martin eds. _Externalism and Self-Knowledge_. Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications, 1998. ISBN: 1575861062. (Worth considering).

Grading
-------

Course grading is based on a twenty page term paper, on a topic of your choosing. See me to discuss your topic first. A draft or detailed outline (minimum 5 pages) must be submitted before the end of the term.
